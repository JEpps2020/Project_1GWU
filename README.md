User Story

AS an avid bird watcher 
I WANT a website to retrieve information about birds
SO THAT I can identify birds that I encounter.

GIVEN a website with links to bird information
WHEN I click to view news stories
THEN I am taken to a page that presents news stories about birds
WHEN I click on a news story to read more
THEN a new page opens and takes me to the site with the news story
WHEN the page loads (or I click button to view local birds on mobile)
THEN I am presented a list of birds that have been reported in my area in the past 3 days
WHEN I enter the name of a bird into the search
THEN I am presented a new page with information about the bird
